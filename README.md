<p>
  Hey there! I'm a <strong>Full-Stack</strong> Developer <em>Bootcamp Graduate</em> from Skill Distillery. Besides the technologies I've learned there, I really got hooked in the world of programming.</p>
<p>
  From joining the hardest branch in the military, to thinking like a programmer, I just can't seem to stop chasing the difficult path. But that's just my idea of fun.
